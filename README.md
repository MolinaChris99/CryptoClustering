### CrptopClustering 
-----------------------------
This project involved applying K-Means clustering to analyze cryptocurrency market changes. We explored clustering performance using both raw scaled data and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-transformed data to evaluate how dimensionality reduction affects clustering accuracy and efficiency.
###Key Takeaways:
* The dataset was normalized using StandardScaler to ensure all features contributed equally to clustering.
* The optimal number of clusters (k) was determined to be 4, based on both the scaled and PCA-transformed data.
* PCA confirmed the clustering results, reinforcing the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction in this context.
